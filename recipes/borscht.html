        <h3>Disclaimer:</h3>
        <p>
            I am literally copying Natasha Kitchens' recipe and the steps she gives,
            but putting it onto this website for practice. I don't
            claim it or anything like that. Watch her on YouTube :D.

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel, grate and/or slice all vegetables (keeping sliced potatoes in cold water to prevent browning until
                ready to use then drain).</li>
            <li>Heat a large soup pot (5 1/2 Qt or larger) over medium/high heat and add 2 Tbsp olive oil. Add grated beets
                and saut√© 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until beets are softened. </li>
            <li>Add 8 cups broth and 2 cups water. Add sliced potatoes and sliced carrots then cook for 10-15 minutes or until
                easily pierced with a fork.</li>
            <li>While potatoes are cooking, place a large skillet over medium/high heat and add 2 Tbsp oil. Add chopped onion,
                celery and bell pepper. Saute stirring occasionally until softened and lightly golden (7-8 minutes). Add 4 Tbsp
                Ketchup and stir fry 30 seconds then transfer to the soup pot to continue cooking with the potatoes.</li>
            <li>When potatoes and carrots reach desired softness, add 1 can of beans with their juice, 2 bay leaves, 2-3 Tbsp
                white vinegar, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 1 pressed garlic clove, and 3 Tbsp chopped dill. Simmer for
                an additional 2-3 minutes and add more salt and vinegar to taste.</li>
        </ol>
