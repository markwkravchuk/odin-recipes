            I am literally copying Gordon Ramsays's recipe and the steps he gives,
            but putting it onto this website for practice. I don't
            claim it or anything like that. Watch him on YouTube :D.

        <ul>
            <li>1/2 lb. Ground Beef short rib 80/20</li>
            <li>1/2 lb. Ground Beef brisket 80/20</li>
            <li>1 lb. Ground Beef chuck 80/20</li>
            <li>4 5â€³ Brioche Bun</li>
            <li>4 Slices Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>1 Large Onion, Cut into thick Slices</li>
            <li>1 Large Tomato Cut into thick Slices</li>
            <li>4 Lettuce Boston bib Lettuce leaves</li>
            <li>4 Oz. Mayo - Dijon Mustard spread</li>
            <li>4 Tbsp. Unsalted butter to baste burgers and Toast Buns</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Blend Sirloin chuck, brisket, and short rib ground beef mix, then mix in with some egg;
                I suggest you prepare a day ahead before grilling. Patty into 8 oz patties and then refrigerator
                24 hours before using; this will help the patties stay together and do not come apart as you are grilling them.</li>
            <li>Make sure the grill is scorching before putting the patties on your grill. Now season the
                patties with salt and pepper and add a little oil. Make sure to roll the sides of the patties,
                so they get fully seasoned as well.</li>
            <li>Make sure burgers are at room temperature 10 minutes before grilling them. Look for the hottest
                part on the grill and place the burger patties down on the grill. The real secret is to move the
                patties as little as possible once you place the burgers patties on the grill.</li>
            <li>Beginning preparing the hamburger buns as the burgers are cooking. Season buns with salt and
                pepper, and crisp them on both sides on the grill.</li>
            <li>Season the thick-sliced onions with salt and pepper, add some oil and place onions on the grill
                as the buns and burgers are cooking.</li>
            <li>Now start basting your patties by brushing them on each side just about two minutes before taking
                off the grill to add some more flavor. Grill each burger patties for 3 1/2 to 4 minutes on both sides.</li>
            <li>Thirty seconds before patties come off the grill; you need to season the patties again, then add your
                jack cheese on the top to melt while burgers are still on the grill.</li>
            <li>Setup the Brioche buns; add mustard mayo blend, lettuce, and tomatoes before taking the burger patties
                off the grill. First, you start by placing a tablespoon full of mustard mayo blend on both sides of the
                top and bottom of the bun. Then gently fold the lettuce to fit onto the bun and press down to lettuce,
                making sure it stays folded.</li>
            <li>After the mustard mayo blend and lettuce, add a thick slice of tomato on top of the lettuce, then season
                tomato with salt and pepper, and a dab more of mayo on top.</li>
            <li>Add the burgers on each of the Pre-made dressed Brioche buns. Place grilled onions on top of each patty
                finish by placing the top bun.</li>
        </ol>
